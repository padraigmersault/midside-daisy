Here's my attempt at a tiny, portable mid-side decoder using the daisy platform. I was trying to solve the problem of MS monitoring on a Zoom F3. I run line level signals from the Zoom into the audio inputs on the Daisy Seed, which outputs a stereo signal to a tiny headphone amp board powered by the USB 5V. A single potentiometer connected to ADC0 controls the stereo width by controlling the amplitude of the side channel. Another potentiometer acts as a volume control for the headphone amplifier. ALl of this fits into a standard guitar pedal enclosure and is powered by a usb battery bank.
A common problem with the daisy seed is noise. It's important to use an electrolytic capacitor between 5V and ground and another between 3V3 and ground. For the annoying high-frequency noise, my code only updates the ADC0 value periodically, rather than every sample. Also I'm using a 96k sample rate and a blocksize of 4, which helps. The goal of this project is to MONITOR a decoded MS signal, not to record. A wonderful thing about MS is that you can just record the raw signals and decode them later in a DAW. For this reason, a little noise is acceptable to me.
